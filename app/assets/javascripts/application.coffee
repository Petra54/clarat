###
This is a manifest file that'll be compiled into application.js, which will include all the files
listed below.

Any JavaScript/Coffee file within this directory, lib/assets/javascripts, vendor/assets/javascripts,
or vendor/assets/javascripts of plugins, if any, can be referenced here using a relative path.

It's not advisable to add code directly here, but if you do, it'll appear at the bottom of the
compiled file.

Read Sprockets README (https://github.com/sstephenson/sprockets#sprockets-directives) for details
about supported directives.
