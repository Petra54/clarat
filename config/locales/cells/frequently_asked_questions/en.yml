    question_1:
      question: "What is clarat?"
      answer: |
        clarat is an online platform where you can find help and support
        offerings. We help you find the help you need. We do not offer advising
        or consulting services – there are experts for that. And it is precisely
        their offerings that you will find on clarat: on <b>clarat
        family</b> and on <b>clarat refugees</b>:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <b>clarat family</b> helps children, adolescents, and families, who are
        facing problems and who are looking for help nearby. Here you can easily
        find help for yourself, your family, and your friends, or for other
        children, adolescents, and families you might know. If you want to
        better understand what clarat family is all about, you can watch this
        short %{link_to_family_movie}.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>clarat refugees</b> helps refugees who are looking for support
        nearby. You can easily find help here: for yourself, your family, and
        your friends. You can also find help if you are not a refugee yourself,
        but know refugees who need help.
        </li>

    question_2:
      question: "Why does clarat exist?"
      answer: |
        There are many help and support offerings available in Germany for
        people who really need help. However, these offerings can often be hard
        to find. On the one hand, this is because it can be hard to know exactly
        where to look for them. On the other hand, this is because the contact
        partners are not always clear. That is exactly what we want to change.
    question_3:
      question: "How does clarat work?"
      answer: |
        Enter a search term describing your problem. Then add the location. You
        will find matching help and support offerings in your area. You will
        also be shown the help you can get over the phone or online. Have a look
        %{ref_to_how_to_find_right_help} for information about how to find what
        you’re looking for. When you click on the title of an offering, we tell
        you what you need to do to obtain the help you need, for example whether
        you need to call or whether you can just go there.

    question_4:
      question: "Is clarat free of charge?"
      answer: |
        clarat is and will stay free of charge. Anyone can search on <b>clarat
        family</b> for help and support for children, adolescents, and families
        for free. And anyone can search on <b>clarat refugees</b> for help for
        refugees for free.
    question_5:
      question: "Can I search anonymously on clarat?"
      answer: |
        Searching on clarat is always anonymous. That means that no one at
        clarat will know your name or your address
    question_6:
      question: "Is the information on clarat up to-date?"
      answer: |
        We regularly check whether the information on clarat is still up-to-date.
        After all, this is the only way we can ensure that clarat is really
        helpful for children, adolescents, families, and refugees. If the
        information is outdated, then we will update it.
    question_7:
      question: "Is clarat available for all of Germany?"
      answer: |
        Some of the offerings found on <b>clarat family</b> and <b>clarat
        refugees</b> can be accessed wherever you are. There are many offerings
        that allow you to receive help over the phone or online, for example
        via e-mail, via chat, or in an online forum. On <b>clarat refugees</b>
        you can find offerings for all of Germany. On <b>clarat family</b> you
        can find a large selection of offerings for Berlin, but we will soon
        start compiling information for other larger cities in Germany.
    question_8:
      question: "What is special about clarat?"

        meaning all in one place. We also tell you exactly what you need to do
        to get help. We always use simple language that anyone can easily

        help over the phone or online, if that’s what you prefer.
    question_5:
      anchor: "how_to_find_right_help"
      question: "How can I find the right kind of help?"
      answer: |
        There are two ways of looking for help and support offerings:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        If you know the word describing your problem or the help you need, then
        enter the search term in the search field where it says <b>What?</b> on
        the main page. In the search field where it says <b>Where?</b> you can
        enter a location. You can also click on the word <b>Where?</b> first and
        then on the tab <b>Use my location</b>. Then click on the magnifying
        glass and press Enter. You will be shown offerings in your area!
        </li>
        <li>
        If you don’t know the exact word describing your problem you can try
        searching our categories. If, for example, you’re having trouble with
        your homework, you can click on the book. On the left side you will see
        a selection of terms on the topics of learning and working. Pick one.
        Enter a location in the field that says <b>Where?</b> You can also click
        on the word <b>Where?</b> and then on <b>Use my location</b>. Then click
        on the magnifying glass and press Enter. You will be shown offerings in

        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    question_6:
      question: "Will I find help that is free of charge?"
      answer: |
        Many of the offerings that you will find on clarat are free of charge.
        However there are also offerings for which you have to pay. That doesn’t
        necessarily mean that you will have to pay for them yourself. Sometimes
        health insurance or a public service covers the costs. The best option
        is always to ask the organization directly. That way you can make sure
        the offer is free of charge for you or not.
    question_7:
      question: "Will I find help where I can stay anonymous?"
      answer: |
        Some of the offerings you will find on clarat can be used anonymously.
        That means that you don’t need to tell anyone your name. If an offering
        can be used anonymously, this will be stated under <i>What do you have
        to do?</i> If it is not mentioned there, it is best to ask the
        organization directly.
    question_8:
      question: "Can I find help regarding disabilities on clarat family?"
      answer: |
        As a child or adolescent, you can find help and support offerings if
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        you have a mental illness, meaning if you are suffering from
        psychological or emotional problems.
        </li>
        <li>
        you have a parent with a disability, regardless of whether they have a
        mental or physical disability.
        </li>
        <li>
        you have a brother or sister with a disability, regardless of whether
        they have a mental or physical disability.
        </li>
        </ul>
        </p>
    question_9:
      question: "How can I filter my search?"
      answer: |
        Start your search for help and support offerings. If you want to know
        how you can find the right kind of help, you can read about that
        %{ref_to_how_to_find_right_help}. If you are on the results page you

        in German.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Help for whom?</b> You can select who the help is for. If you are
        looking for support for your whole family, click on <i>for families</i>.
        If you are a child and you are looking for help for yourself, click on
        <i>for children and adolescents</i>.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>Gender?</b> You can select whether you are looking for offerings
        <i>only for boys and men</i> or <i>only for girls and women</i>. If you
        do not select anything here, you will be shown both options.
        </li>
        <li>
        <b>How?</b> You have several choices. If you would like to find
        offerings where you obtain help in person, click on <i>in person</i>. If
        you prefer to stay at home, click <i>by telephone</i> or <i>online</i>.
        You can then choose between offerings where you receive help over the
        phone, via e-mail, chat, an online forum, or online courses.

        There could be several reasons for this.
        <p>
        <ul>

        It could be that your search term can’t be found. In that case, you
        should try another search with a different term. If you can’t think of
        another term, try searching by clicking on our icons. On clarat that
        means: <i>search by categories</i>. You can read about it
        %{ref_to_how_to_find_right_help}.
        </li>
        <li>
        If you live in a rural area and can’t seem to find any offerings nearby,
        enter the name of the nearest city in the search box that says
        <b>Where?</b> Or try searching for help offered via telephone or online.
        </li>
        <li>
        Another reason could be that we haven’t yet compiled any information on
        offerings in your district or city.
        </li>
        <li>
        Or we don’t yet have any matching offerings in our database. In order
        for us to change that, we need your feedback. If you can’t find what
        you’re looking for, please send an e-mail to %{mailto_clarat}. You can

    question_11:
      question: "What can I do if I don’t know whether a help or support offering is right for me?"
      answer: |
        First, you should check what kind of problem the offering addresses. You
        can find information in the description under <b>What’s it about?</b> If
        you don’t think that an offering provides the right kind of help for
        you, try a different one. If you’re still not sure, try contacting the
        organization. Usually there’s a number you can call or an e-mail address.
        You can find these contact details under <i>How can you get in touch?</i>
    question_12:
      question: "How do I find help if I’m not looking for myself, but for someone else?"
      answer: |
        On clarat you can also look for help and support offerings for others,
        for example for a friend, as an uncle for your nephew, as a mother for
        your child, or as a teacher for your student. However, in our
        descriptions we usually address the person who will be receiving the
        help (usually children and adolescents).
  section_3:
    heading: "Do you have questions about the language used on clarat?"
    question_1:
      question: "Why does clarat use simple language?"
      answer: |
        Every person looking for help on clarat should be able to find it
        easily. That’s why clarat developed its own language. clarat’s language
        is easy to understand because it is based on the rules of plain
        language. clarat is for everyone and should be understood by everyone:
        by children, adolescents, and families; by people from different
        countries, those who were born here, and those who have just arrived in
        Germany; by those who speak German well and those who don’t.
    question_2:
      question: "Why does clarat use the abbreviation <i>LGBTI</i>?"
      answer: |
        On clarat you can find offerings for children, adolescents, and families
        of all sexual orientations. That means for lesbians, gays, bisexuals,
        transsexuals, and intersexuals. However, we can’t always list all of
        these terms since we want our descriptions to be short and easy to
        understand. That’s why we use the abbreviation LGBTI.
    question_3:
      question: "Why does clarat use the term <i>migrants</i>?"
      answer: |
        At clarat we use simple language. That’s why we use words that are easy
        to understand and that many people are familiar with. We also try to be
        as politically correct as possible. That’s why we usually use the word
        migrants instead of the term foreigners or an expression like <i>people
        with a migration background</i>.
    question_4:
      question: "Why does clarat use the term <i>refugees</i>?"
      answer: |
        On clarat we want everyone to quickly understand who is meant. Since
        most people use the term refugees, so do we, even though displaced
        persons might be more accurate. On clarat we try to be as accurate as
        possible, but it is more important to us that people understand
        everything quickly. That way everyone looking for help and support can
        find it even quicker.
  section_4:
    heading: "Do you have questions about using clarat in different languages?"
    question_1:
      anchor: "how_many_languages"
      question: "Which languages are available on clarat?"
      answer: |
        You can read all of clarat’s pages in German and English.
    question_2:
      question: "How can I use clarat in my language?"
      answer: |
        You can select your language at the top of the page. Google Translate
        will then automatically translate everything into your language. Since
        it’s an automatic translation, there might be a few mistakes. The
        translation could thus sound a bit strange.
    question_3:
      question: "Why do the texts sound so strange in my language?"
      answer: |
        Google Translate generates automatic translations, which is why there
        might be a few mistakes. This means that the translation might not
        always be entirely correct.
  section_5:
    heading: "Do you have questions regarding your organization?"
    question_1:
      question: "Why are my organization’s offerings on clarat?"
      answer: |
        Your organization offers help to children, adolescents, and families.
        That’s why we’ve included your offerings on <b>clarat family</b>. We
        want to enable those in need to find your help and support offerings as
        fast and as easily as possible.
        <br>
        Or your organization’s offerings provide help for refugees, who have
        fled to Germany. That’s why we’ve included them on <b>clarat
        refugees</b>. We want to give refugees quick and simple information on
        where they can find the help they need.
    question_2:
      question: "What does clarat do for my organization?"
      answer: |
        <b>clarat family</b> helps children, adolescents, and families find your
        organization’s offerings. <b>clarat refugees</b> helps refugees find the
        support they need. Your organization’s offerings can only be found if
        people know about your organization. To make sure that everybody really
        understands the kind of help your organization provides, we explain
        everything in plain language. In addition to that, all offerings can be
        automatically translated into a variety of languages.
    question_3:
      question: "How can I find my organization’s offerings on clarat?"
      answer: |
        You can enter the name of your organization in the search field where it
        says <b>What?</b> and its location in the search field that says
        <b>Where?</b> You will then be shown a list of offerings provided in
        that location. If your organization is based in more than one location
        in Berlin, just enter Berlin in the search field where it says <b>Where?</b>
    question_4:
      question: "Why do the descriptions of our offerings on clarat differ from the ones we have on our website?"
      answer: |
        All offerings on clarat are written in simple language so that everyone
        can easily find help. Using simple language means that complicated
        things need to be simplified. Doing this also ensures that the automatic
        translation is much better. If you think that something should be
        explained differently, please let us know by sending an e-mail to
        %{mailto_clarat}.

        target: "_blank"
    question_5:
      question: "Why does one of my organization’s offering turn into several offerings on clarat?"
      answer: |
        We want to make it possible for anyone to search for help as easily as
        possible. That’s why we split up your organization’s offerings so that
        there is just one offering for each specific problem. That way people
        searching for help can find exactly the help they need.
    question_6:
      question: "Why can’t I find all of my organization’s offerings on clarat?"
      answer: |
        There are many help and support offerings for children, adolescents,
        families, and refugees in Germany. Since clarat is still under
        construction, it is possible that we have not yet been able to include
        all of your organization’s offerings on clarat, or we may have decided
        that not all of your organization’s offerings can be included on clarat
        at this time. on <b>clarat family</b> you can only find:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        offerings that help people with problems
        </li>
        <li>
        for-cost offerings provided by charitable organizations
        </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        You will not find any offerings that solely provide medical help.
        </p>
        On <b>clarat refugees</b> you will currently not find:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        first admission facilities and refugee shelters
        </li>
        <li>
        church asylum offerings
        </li>

    question_8:
      question: "Why isn’t my organization on clarat?"
      answer: |
        There are two possible reasons for that:
        <p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        It could be that we haven’t started compiling information about
        offerings at your organization’s location. clarat is being developed
        gradually. It is thus possible that we haven’t had a chance to include
        your organization yet.
        </li>
        <li>
        It is also possible that your organization’s offerings don’t match our
        criteria. clarat only includes offerings on very specific topics. You
        can find out what those topics are %{ref_to_who_finds_help}. If you want
        us to include your organization’s offerings on clarat, let us know. You
        can send us an e-mail to %{mailto_clarat} or call us at
